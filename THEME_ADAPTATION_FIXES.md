# Theme Adaptation Fixes

## Problem Summary
Two components were not properly adapting to theme changes:
1. **FilterModal component** - Background and text colors were not updating when theme changed
2. **Navigation header in venue/[id].tsx** - Header colors were not updating when theme changed

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Navigation Theme Issue**: The navigation theme in `_layout.tsx` was created once during component initialization and never updated when the theme changed.
2. **FilterModal Issue**: The BottomSheetModal component was using a static style reference that didn't react to theme changes.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Navigation Theme Reactivity (`app/_layout.tsx`)
**Before:**
```tsx
const isDark = UnistylesRuntime.themeName === 'dark';
const navigationTheme = createNavigationTheme(isDark);
```

**After:**
```tsx
const { rt } = useUnistyles();
const navigationTheme = useMemo(
  () => createNavigationTheme(rt.themeName === 'dark'),
  [rt.themeName]
);
```

**Changes:**
- Replaced direct `UnistylesRuntime` access with `useUnistyles()` hook
- Wrapped navigation theme creation in `useMemo` with `rt.themeName` dependency
- Now the navigation theme will automatically update when the system theme changes

### 2. Fixed FilterModal Theme Reactivity (`components/home/components/FilterModal.tsx`)
**Before:**
```tsx
<BottomSheetModal
  backgroundStyle={styles.modalBackgroundStyle}
  // ...
>
```

**After:**
```tsx
const { theme } = useUnistyles();

const backgroundStyle = useMemo(() => ({
  backgroundColor: theme.colors.background,
}), [theme.colors.background]);

<BottomSheetModal
  backgroundStyle={backgroundStyle}
  // ...
>
```

**Changes:**
- Added `useUnistyles()` hook to subscribe to theme changes
- Created reactive `backgroundStyle` that updates when theme colors change
- Removed static `modalBackgroundStyle` from styles object
- Now the modal background will automatically update when theme changes

### 3. Verified Venue Header Implementation (`app/venue/[id].tsx`)
The venue header was already correctly implemented:
- Uses `useUnistyles()` hook to get theme
- Navigation options useEffect includes `theme.colors.text` in dependencies
- Should already be working correctly

## Testing the Fixes

### Method 1: System Theme Changes (Recommended)
1. Open the app on a device/simulator
2. Navigate to a venue details page and open the filter modal
3. Change your device's system theme (Settings > Display & Brightness > Dark/Light)
4. Observe that both the navigation header and filter modal adapt their colors immediately

### Method 2: Manual Theme Testing (Development Only)
1. Import and add the `ThemeDebugger` component to any screen:
```tsx
import { ThemeDebugger } from '@/components/debug/ThemeDebugger';

// Add to your component's render:
{__DEV__ && <ThemeDebugger />}
```

2. Use the debugger to:
   - Toggle adaptive themes on/off
   - Manually switch between light/dark themes
   - View current theme information
   - See color previews

### Expected Behavior After Fixes
- **Navigation Header**: Background, text, and icon colors should immediately adapt when theme changes
- **FilterModal**: Modal background and all text colors should immediately adapt when theme changes
- **All Components**: Should maintain proper contrast and readability in both light and dark themes

## Technical Details

### Theme System Architecture
- Uses `react-native-unistyles` with adaptive themes enabled
- Themes are defined in `unistyles.ts` with light and dark variants
- Navigation theme is created in `utils/navigationTheme.ts`
- Components use `useUnistyles()` hook to subscribe to theme changes

### Key Principles Applied
1. **Reactive Theme Access**: Use `useUnistyles()` hook instead of direct `UnistylesRuntime` access
2. **Dependency Management**: Include theme values in useEffect/useMemo dependencies
3. **Component Re-rendering**: Ensure components re-render when theme changes
4. **Style Reactivity**: Create dynamic styles that respond to theme changes

## Files Modified
- `app/_layout.tsx` - Fixed navigation theme reactivity
- `components/home/components/FilterModal.tsx` - Fixed modal background reactivity
- `components/debug/ThemeDebugger.tsx` - Added development testing component (new file)

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] Navigation header colors change when switching themes
- [ ] FilterModal background and text colors change when switching themes
- [ ] Venue details page header adapts to theme changes
- [ ] All text remains readable in both light and dark themes
- [ ] No console errors or warnings related to theme changes
