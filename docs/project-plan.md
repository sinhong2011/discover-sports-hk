Here’s an updated **project plan in English** for your "Tai Cheung Yi"/Easy Venue View sports venue booking app, tailored for Expo (React Native):

***

## 1. Project Vision & Goals

- **Purpose:** Create a cross-platform app for Hong Kong users to easily check and manage sports venue availability using open government data.
- **Platforms:** iOS, Android (possible Web support via Expo).
- **Core Value:** Fast, easy, mobile-first access to venue availability and booking support.

***

## 2. Tech Stack

- **Main Framework:** Expo (React Native managed workflow)
- **Language:** TypeScript/JavaScript
- **APIs:** Venue data served from custom API endpoints for better performance and reliability.
- **UI:** React Navigation, Expo components, or third-party UI kit (e.g., NativeBase).
- **Notifications:** Expo Push Notifications for reminders and alerts.
- **Ads & Monetization:** Google AdMob via supported Expo packages.
- **Storage:** AsyncStorage for device data and caching; custom API for venue data storage.
- **Version Control:** GitHub/GitLab.

***

## 3. Key Features

- **Venue Search:** Real-time inquiry of available slots, venue filtering by location/type/date.
- **History & Bookmarks:** View past searches/bookings, quickly repeat or track favorite venues.
- **Personalized Notifications:** Push reminders for slot updates, booking windows, and activity times.
- **User Ratings & Feedback:** (Optional, phase 2) Allow users to rate, comment, and share venue experiences.
- **Ad Integration:** Banner/interstitial/rewarded ads for revenue.
- **Settings:** User profile, preferences, notification controls, language/localization options.
- **Support:** FAQ, app guide, contact support.

***

## 4. App Navigation (Initial)

- **Home tab:** Venue search, main dashboard.
- **Settings tab:** User preferences, notification settings, help.

***

## 5. Milestones

1. **Planning & API Integration**
   - Confirm data sources and endpoints.
   - Define MVP features and wireframes.

2. **Framework & Basic Screens**
   - Initialize Expo app, set up navigation and Home/Settings tabs.
   - Create prototype venue search page connected to test/open API.

3. **Feature Sprint**
   - Implement filtering, favorites/history, and notifications.
   - Integrate ad modules and basic analytics.

4. **Testing & Optimization**
   - Conduct device testing (iOS/Android).
   - Refine UI, fix bugs, improve performance.

5. **Release Preparation**
   - Draft privacy policy and compliance docs.
   - Use EAS Build for app packaging.
   - Prepare App Store and Google Play submissions.

6. **Beta Launch & Feedback**
   - Collect user feedback, monitor performance and ad revenue.
   - Plan and prioritize upgrades (e.g., user reviews, social sharing, waitlist features).

***

## 6. Post-launch & Expansion

- Add advanced features: waitlists, web support, rating/review system.
- Cloud sync for cross-device history.
- Promote via local sports communities and partners.

***

## 7. Risks & Considerations

- Government API data limits (only remaining slots—mitigate via reminders, favorites, community info).
- Expo managed workflow: quick development, but some native iOS features (widgets, Dynamic Island) need advanced integration later.
- Growth phase: Monitor usage; plan native features (if needed) via Expo “bare workflow.”

***

**Summary:**  
With Expo and React Native, you can rapidly deliver an MVP to both iOS and Android. Start lean with venue search, user settings, notifications, and ads. Expand in future iterations based on user feedback and market needs.
