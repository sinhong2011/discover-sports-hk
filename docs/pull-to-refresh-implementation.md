# Pull-to-Refresh Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of pull-to-refresh functionality in the DatePage component, which allows users to manually trigger fresh data fetches that bypass the intelligent 30-minute caching strategy.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced useSportVenues Hook

The `useSportVenues` hook was enhanced to support intelligent caching while maintaining compatibility with manual refresh operations:

#### Key Features:
- **Intelligent Caching**: Automatically checks if cached data is less than 30 minutes old
- **Cache Bypass**: The `refetch()` method always fetches fresh data from the API
- **Store Synchronization**: Fresh data from refetch operations updates the Zustand store
- **Cache Metadata**: Returns `isCacheHit` and `cacheAge` for debugging and monitoring

#### Cache Logic:
```typescript
function isCacheValid(lastUpdated: string): boolean {
  try {
    const lastUpdatedTime = new Date(lastUpdated).getTime();
    const currentTime = Date.now();
    const timeDifference = currentTime - lastUpdatedTime;
    
    // Return true if less than 30 minutes have passed
    return timeDifference < THIRTY_MINUTES;
  } catch {
    // If timestamp parsing fails, consider cache invalid
    return false;
  }
}
```

### 2. DatePage Component Enhancement

The DatePage component was updated to integrate FlashList's built-in pull-to-refresh functionality:

#### Changes Made:
- Added `isRefetching` and `refetch` from HomeTabContext
- Implemented `handleRefresh` callback that calls the refetch method
- Configured FlashList with `onRefresh` and `refreshing` props
- Added error handling for failed refresh operations

#### Pull-to-Refresh Handler:
```typescript
const handleRefresh = useCallback(async () => {
  try {
    await refetch();
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling is managed by the useSportVenues hook and HomeTabProvider
    console.warn('Pull-to-refresh failed:', error);
  }
}, [refetch]);
```

#### Conditional Pull-to-Refresh with Gesture Blocking:
The pull-to-refresh functionality is conditionally enabled based on the FilterBar scroll state, with complete gesture blocking when disabled:

```typescript
// Create custom RefreshControl that can be completely disabled
const refreshControl = useMemo(() => {
  if (isFilterBarScrolledOut) {
    // When FilterBar is scrolled out (hidden), enable pull-to-refresh
    return (
      <RefreshControl
        refreshing={isRefetching}
        onRefresh={handleRefresh}
        enabled={true} // Enable pull-to-refresh
      />
    );
  }

  // When FilterBar is visible, block pull-to-refresh gesture completely
  return (
    <RefreshControl
      refreshing={false}
      onRefresh={() => {}} // No-op function
      enabled={false} // Disable pull-to-refresh
    />
  );
}, [isFilterBarScrolledOut, isRefetching, handleRefresh]);

<FlashList
  // ... other props
  // Use custom RefreshControl that completely blocks pull gesture when FilterBar is visible
  refreshControl={refreshControl}
/>
```

This ensures that:
- **When FilterBar is visible** (`isFilterBarScrolledOut = false`): Pull gesture is completely blocked - no visual feedback or refresh capability
- **When FilterBar is scrolled out** (`isFilterBarScrolledOut = true`): Full pull-to-refresh functionality is enabled for the venue list

### Key Benefits:
- **Complete Gesture Blocking**: Users cannot even initiate the pull gesture when FilterBar is visible
- **No Visual Confusion**: No refresh indicator appears when pull-to-refresh is disabled
- **Better UX**: Clear distinction between when pull-to-refresh is available vs. when main scroll refresh should be used

#### FlashList Configuration:
```typescript
<FlashList
  // ... existing props
  onRefresh={handleRefresh}
  refreshing={isRefetching}
/>
```

### 3. Data Flow

1. **Initial Load**: 
   - Hook checks for cached data and its age
   - If cache is valid (< 30 minutes), returns cached data immediately
   - If cache is invalid or missing, fetches from API

2. **Pull-to-Refresh**:
   - User pulls down on FlashList
   - `handleRefresh` is called
   - `refetch()` method bypasses cache and fetches fresh data
   - `isRefetching` state shows loading indicator
   - Fresh data updates Zustand store with new `lastUpdated` timestamp

3. **Subsequent Loads**:
   - Uses the fresh data from cache until it becomes stale again

## Benefits

### Performance Improvements:
- **Reduced API Calls**: Intelligent caching prevents unnecessary requests
- **Faster Load Times**: Cached data loads instantly
- **Bandwidth Savings**: Less network usage for repeated requests

### User Experience:
- **Manual Control**: Users can force refresh when needed
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear loading states during refresh
- **Accessibility**: Proper accessibility labels for pull-to-refresh
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing FlashList functionality

### Developer Experience:
- **Cache Metadata**: Debug information available for monitoring
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling for failed requests
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing components continue to work unchanged

## Testing

Comprehensive tests were added to verify:
- Pull-to-refresh triggers refetch
- Loading states are properly displayed
- Error handling works correctly
- Cache logic functions as expected
- Accessibility features are maintained

## Configuration

### Cache Duration
The cache duration is configurable via the `THIRTY_MINUTES` constant:
```typescript
const THIRTY_MINUTES = 30 * 60 * 1000; // 30 minutes in milliseconds
```

### Error Handling
Errors are handled at multiple levels:
- Network errors in the API client
- Cache validation errors in the hook
- Refresh errors in the component

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Configurable cache duration per sport type
- Background refresh when app becomes active
- Offline support with cached data
- Push notifications for data updates
- Analytics for cache hit rates and refresh patterns

## Accessibility

The implementation includes proper accessibility support:
- Pull-to-refresh gesture is natively supported by FlashList
- Loading states are announced to screen readers
- Error states provide appropriate feedback
- All interactive elements have proper accessibility labels

## Performance Considerations

- **Memory Usage**: Zustand store persists data efficiently
- **Network Usage**: Intelligent caching reduces bandwidth consumption
- **Battery Life**: Fewer API calls improve battery performance
- **Render Performance**: Memoized callbacks prevent unnecessary re-renders
